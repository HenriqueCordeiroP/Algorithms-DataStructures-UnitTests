# Algorithms and DataStructures

A repository to keep the Algorithms and Data Structures I've worked with until the present moment and time them for comparison motives

### Why Python?

I first studied them using C and wanted to try them in Python =D


## Unit Tests
In order to check if what I was doing was correct, I needed to test the code and I chose to write Unit Tests using Pytest so I didn't have to write a lot of function calls and save some time while studying these types of tests.

### Installation of Pytest
```bash
pip install -U pytest
```

The algorithms were timed using the "time" module in Python

## Running
You can run the tests by going into the repo folder in the console and running
```bash
pytest
```
However, if you want to see the print statements that contain the timing of the algorithms, you can specifically run them using
```bash
pytest -s test/test_algorithms.py
```
